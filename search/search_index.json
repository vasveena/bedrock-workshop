In your browser, open AWS Console Login link provided to you via email. Example: https://123456789012.signin.aws.amazon.com/console . Enter the AWS user name and password provided via email to login to the AWS Console. Once logged in, go to Sagemaker Console -> Domains . Important: Make sure you are in N. Virginia (us-east-1) region You should see a domain named genai-domain . Select the domain. Click on Add user to add a user profile. Under General Settings , name your user profile with your first and last name. Example: AaronSmith . Keep the execution role default. Go to Next. Do not change any other configurations. Click Submit and create your user profile. You may see the following error. Ignore it. Now you should see your user profile created. Click on Launch -> Studio (on the right hand side). This will take you to Sagemaker Studio interface. Once the interface is initialized, go to File -> New -> Terminal . In the Terminal, we will run the following commands. sudo yum install -y wget sudo yum install -y unzip wget https://vasveena-bedrock.s3.amazonaws.com/bedrock-workshop-main.zip unzip bedrock-workshop-main.zip rm -rf bedrock-workshop-main.zip After the running the commands, navigate to the icon to see the bedrock-workshop-main folder. Click on the folder bedrock-workshop-main and go to 00_Intro folder and open bedrock-boto3-setup.ipynb file. Change the Image and Kernel to Data Science 3.0 and Python 3 . It takes 4-5 minutes for the kernel to initialize. Once the kernel is started, make sure the right image and kernel is selected in the top right corner. This is very important . If you choose an incorrect kernel, the notebooks will NOT run as expected. Note: You need to do steps 14 and 15 for ALL the Bedrock notebooks you will be running in this workshop. Start running the notebook blocks. In the block where you see Uncomment the following lines to run from your local environment outside of the AWS account with Bedrock access , add the following values in the cell. You do not need to un-comment the existing lines. import os os.environ['BEDROCK_ASSUME_ROLE'] = 'arn:aws:iam::626103420214:role/bedrockadmin' Note: In all notebooks, you will follow the same procedure wherever you see the comment Uncomment the following lines to run from your local environment outside of the AWS account with Bedrock access . Run the notebook blocks and make sure they are getting executed without errors. Now, we will run the other notebooks.
